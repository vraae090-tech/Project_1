                No, unquestionably this is not — <em>more geometrico</em> — the best way of beginning my story. To claim that it is true is nowadays the convention of every made-up story.

                I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires" target="_blank" class="story-link">Belgrano Street, in Buenos Aires</a>. Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">stranger<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a stranger knocks</span></a> stood there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features — or perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way. Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he was a <span class="hidden-text">stranger</span>. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I found out that he came from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney" target="_blank" class="story-link">Orkneys</a>.

                I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of <span class="hidden-text">gloom</span> emanated from him &mdash; as it does now from <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-1" class="cross-link to-ruins">me<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; who is speaking?</span></a>.

                "I sell Bibles," he said.

            <p class="sand-text">
                Somewhat pedantically, I replied, "In this house are several English Bibles, including the first — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wycliffe%27s_Bible" target="_blank" class="story-link">John Wicliffe's</a>. I also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's — which, from a literary viewpoint, is the worst — and a Latin copy of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate" target="_blank" class="story-link">Vulgate</a>. As you see, it's not exactly <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">Bibles<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; manuscripts in the cabinet</span></a> I stand in need of."
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                After a few moments of <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-7" class="cross-link to-ruins">silence<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the dreamer's silence</span></a>, he said, "I don't only sell Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the outskirts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikaner" target="_blank" class="story-link">Bikaner</a>. It may interest you."

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                He opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It was an <span class="hidden-text">octavo</span> volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through many <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-5" class="cross-link to-paths">hands<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; passed from path to path</span></a>. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. <span class="spotlight-hidden" style="font-size: 0.7rem;">It was heavier than any finite thing should be.</span> On the spine were the words "Holy Writ" and, below them, "Bombay."

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "Nineteenth century, probably," I remarked.

            <p class="sand-text">
                I opened the book at random. The <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">script<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; another script, another maze</span></a> was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries — an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                It was at this point that the stranger said, <span class="sand-text-large" style="display:block; margin: 1.5rem 0;">"Look at the illustration closely. You'll <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">never<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; time splits</span></a> see it again."</span>
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text">
                I noted my place and closed the book. At once, I <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-3" class="cross-link to-ruins">reopened<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; he tried again</span></a> it. Page by page, in vain, I looked for the illustration of the anchor. "It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?" I said to hide my dismay.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "No," he replied. Then, as if confiding a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-3" class="cross-link to-paths">secret<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; Yu Tsun's secret</span></a>, he lowered his voice. "I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination. He told me his book was called the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-6" class="cross-link to-paths">Book of Sand<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; The Garden of Forking Paths</span></a>, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end."

                The stranger asked me to find the first page.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                I laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept <span class="hidden-text">growing</span> from the book. <span class="spotlight-hidden" style="font-size: 0.7rem;">You are holding infinity in your hands.</span>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Again I failed. In a <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-5" class="cross-link to-ruins">voice<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; whose voice?</span></a> that was not mine, I barely managed to stammer, "This can't be."

            <p class="sand-pull-quote">
                "It can't be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is no more or less than infinite. None is the first page, none the last."

            <p class="sand-text">
                "I don't know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest that the terms of an <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-4" class="cross-link to-ruins">infinite series<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; The Circular Ruins</span></a> admit any number."
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text-large" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
                "If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">time<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the garden of forking paths</span></a> is infinite, we may be at any point in time."
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                His speculations irritated me. "You are <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-5" class="cross-link to-ruins">religious<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; he worshiped the gods</span></a>, no doubt?" I asked him.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "Yes, I'm a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book."
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I asked if he were just passing through this part of the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days. It was then that I learned that he was a Scot from the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a great personal affection for Scotland, through my love of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" target="_blank" class="story-link">Stevenson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume" target="_blank" class="story-link">Hume</a>.

                While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned indifference, I asked, "Do you intend to offer this curiosity to the British Museum?"
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "No. I'm offering it to you," he said, and he stipulated a rather high sum for the book.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of my reach, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came up with a scheme.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "I propose a swap," I said. "You got this book for a handful of rupees and a copy of the Bible. I'll offer you the amount of my pension check, which I've just collected, and my black-letter Wicliffe Bible. I inherited it from my ancestors."
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "A black-letter Wicliffe!" he murmured.

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He turned the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-6" class="cross-link to-paths">leaves<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; branching paths</span></a> and studied the title page with all the fervor of a true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliophilia" target="_blank" class="story-link">bibliophile</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                "It's a deal," he said.
            </p>

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                It amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up to sell the book. <span class="spotlight-hidden" style="font-size: 0.7rem;">He wanted to be rid of it.</span> Without counting the money, he put it away.

                I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on the shelf by the Wicliffe, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights" target="_blank" class="story-link"><em>The Thousand and One Nights</em></a>. I went to bed and did not <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-2" class="cross-link to-ruins">sleep<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; to sleep is to dream</span></a>. At three or four in the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-2" class="cross-link to-paths">morning<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; before the sun set</span></a>, I turned on the light. I got down the impossible book and leafed through its pages. On one of them I saw engraved a <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-8" class="cross-link to-ruins">mask<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; not to be a man</span></a>. The upper corner of the page carried a number, which I no longer recall, elevated to the ninth power.

            <p class="sand-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. These twin preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I had only a few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. A <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">prisoner<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; condemned to hang</span></a> of the book, I almost never went out anymore. After studying its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort. The small illustrations, I verified, came two thousand pages apart. I set about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was not long in filling up. Never once was an illustration repeated. At night, in the meager intervals my insomnia granted, I <a href="TheCircularRuins.html#ruins-1" class="cross-link to-ruins">dreamed<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; The Circular Ruins</span></a> of the book.

Before retirement, I worked on Mexico Street, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_of_the_Argentine_Republic" target="_blank" class="story-link">Argentine National Library</a>, which contains nine hundred thousand volumes.
