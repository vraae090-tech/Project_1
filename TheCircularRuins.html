                But in a few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zend_language" target="_blank" class="story-link">Zend language</a> has not been contaminated by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">grey<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a stranger at the door</span></a> man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing aside (probably, without feeling) the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-3" class="cross-link to-paths">blades<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a pistol shot</span></a> which were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">bloodstained<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the garden of death</span></a>, up to the circular enclosure crowned with a <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-5" class="cross-link to-sand">stone<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a stone shelf</span></a> tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">flame<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; struck by flame</span></a> and now was that of ashes. This circle was a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-6" class="cross-link to-paths">temple<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; another labyrinth</span></a> which had been devoured by ancient <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-7" class="cross-link to-sand">fires<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; burning it all</span></a>, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-1" class="cross-link to-paths">homage<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a letter from afar</span></a> of men.

                The <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">stranger<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a stranger selling Bibles</span></a> stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-2" class="cross-link to-paths">awakened<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the hazy six o'clock sun</span></a> by the sun high overhead. He was not astonished to find that his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">wounds<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a bullet in the chest</span></a> had healed; he closed his pallid <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">eyes<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; going blind</span></a> and slept, not through weakness of <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-4" class="cross-link to-paths">flesh<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; mortal bodies</span></a> but through determination of will. He knew that this temple was the place required for his <span class="hidden-text">invincible</span> intent; he knew that the incessant <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">trees<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the avenue of damp poplars</span></a> had not succeeded in strangling the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-7" class="cross-link to-sand">ruins<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; hide it among the ruins</span></a> of another propitious temple <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-5" class="cross-link to-paths">downstream<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; follow the path</span></a> which had once belonged to gods now burned and <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">dead<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; many deaths</span></a>; he knew that his immediate obligation was to <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">dream<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; The Book of Sand</span></a>.

                Toward <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">midnight<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the witching hour</span></a> he was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">bird<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; birdless dawn</span></a>. Tracks of bare <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-5" class="cross-link to-paths">feet<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; bear to the left</span></a>, some figs and a jug warned him that the men of the region had been spying respectfully on his <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">sleep<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; sleepless with the book</span></a>, soliciting his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-4" class="cross-link to-paths">protection<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a secret mission</span></a> or afraid of his magic.

                He wanted to dream a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-4" class="cross-link to-paths">man<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; Dr. Yu Tsun</span></a>; he wanted to dream him in minute <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">entirety<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; an infinite object</span></a> and impose him on <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">reality<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; is the book real?</span></a>. <span class="spotlight-hidden" style="font-size: 0.6rem;">As someone once dreamed him.</span>

                This <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-7" class="cross-link to-sand">magic<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the monstrous book</span></a> project had exhausted the entire expanse of his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">mind<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the mind of Ts'ui Pên</span></a>; if someone had asked him his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-4" class="cross-link to-paths">name<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the name of a city</span></a> or to relate some event of his former <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-2" class="cross-link to-sand">life<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a life among books</span></a>, he would not have been able to give an answer. This uninhabited, ruined temple suited him, for it contained a minimum of <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">visible<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; an invisible labyrinth</span></a> world; the proximity of the workmen also suited him, for they took it upon themselves to provide for his frugal needs. The rice and <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">fruit<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the garden's harvest</span></a> they brought him were nourishment enough for his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">body<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the body falls</span></a>, which was consecrated to the sole task of sleeping and <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">dreaming<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the book haunts</span></a>.

                At first, his dreams were <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">chaotic<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; disordered pages</span></a>; then in a short while they became dialectic in nature. The stranger dreamed that he was in the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-6" class="cross-link to-paths">center<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the center of the maze</span></a> of a circular amphitheater which was more or less the burnt temple; <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-2" class="cross-link to-paths">clouds<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a clouded sky</span></a> of taciturn students filled the tiers of seats; the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">faces<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the face at the door</span></a> of the farthest ones hung at a distance of many <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">centuries<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; diverging times</span></a> and as high as the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-3" class="cross-link to-sand">stars<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; countless pages</span></a>, but their features were completely precise. The man lectured his pupils on anatomy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmography" target="_blank" class="story-link">cosmography</a>, and magic: the faces listened anxiously and tried to answer <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">well<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; every answer forks</span></a>, as if they guessed the importance of that <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">examination<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; deciphering a riddle</span></a> which would redeem one of them from his condition of empty <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">illusion<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the impossible book</span></a> and interpolate him into the real world. Asleep or awake, the man thought over the answers of his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">phantoms<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; phantom futures</span></a>, did not allow himself to be deceived by <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">imposters<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the Bible seller</span></a>, and in certain perplexities he sensed a growing <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">intelligence<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a brilliant mind</span></a>. He was seeking a <span class="hidden-text">soul</span> worthy of participating in the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">universe<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; an infinite book</span></a>.
            </p>

            <p class="ruins-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                After nine or ten <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">nights<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; sleepless over the book</span></a> he understood with a certain <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">bitterness<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; an abominable thing</span></a> that he could expect nothing from those pupils who accepted his <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">doctrine<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the theory of Ts'ui Pên</span></a> passively, but that he could expect something from those who occasionally dared to oppose him. The former group, although worthy of <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-2" class="cross-link to-sand">love<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a cherished volume</span></a> and affection, could not ascend to the level of <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-4" class="cross-link to-paths">individuals<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; singular lives</span></a>; the latter <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">pre-existed<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; at any point in time</span></a> to a slightly greater degree. One <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-2" class="cross-link to-paths">afternoon<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; in the afternoon sun</span></a> (now afternoons were also given over to sleep, now he was only awake for a couple hours at daybreak) he dismissed the vast <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-3" class="cross-link to-sand">illusory<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; impossible pages</span></a> student body for good and kept only one pupil. He was a taciturn, <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-3" class="cross-link to-paths">sallow<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a pale face</span></a> boy, at times intractable, and whose sharp features <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">resembled<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a mirror of the seller</span></a> those of his dreamer. The brusque <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">elimination<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the act of killing</span></a> of his fellow students did not disconcert him for long; after a few private <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-5" class="cross-link to-sand">lessons<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; studying the book</span></a>, his progress was enough to astound the teacher.
            </p>

            <p class="ruins-text" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                Nevertheless, a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-10" class="cross-link to-paths">catastrophe<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the final act</span></a> took place. One day, the man emerged from his <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">sleep<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; insomnia</span></a> as if from a viscous <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-3" class="cross-link to-sand">desert<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a desert of pages</span></a>, looked at the useless afternoon <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-2" class="cross-link to-paths">light<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the dying light</span></a> which he immediately confused with the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-1" class="cross-link to-paths">dawn<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a birdless dawn</span></a>, and understood that he had not dreamed. All that night and all day long, the intolerable <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">lucidity<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; terrible clarity</span></a> of <span class="hidden-text">insomnia</span> fell upon him. He tried exploring the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">forest<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; lost in the garden</span></a>, to lose his strength; among the hemlock he barely succeeded in experiencing several short snatches of sleep, veined with <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-5" class="cross-link to-sand">fleeting<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; vanishing images</span></a>, rudimentary <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">visions<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; forking futures</span></a> that were useless. He tried to assemble the student body but scarcely had he articulated a few brief <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-3" class="cross-link to-sand">words<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the book's strange script</span></a> of exhortation when it became <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-6" class="cross-link to-paths">deformed<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a chaotic manuscript</span></a> and was then erased. In his almost perpetual <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">vigil<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; guarding the monstrous book</span></a>, tears of <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-3" class="cross-link to-paths">anger<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the rage of a spy</span></a> burned his old eyes.

                Even though he should penetrate all the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">enigmas<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a riddle whose answer is time</span></a> of a superior and inferior order; much more difficult than weaving a rope out of <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">sand<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; The Book of Sand</span></a> or coining the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-6" class="cross-link to-paths">faceless<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the West wind</span></a> wind.

Before putting it into execution, he spent a <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-7" class="cross-link to-sand">month<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; months of obsession</span></a> recovering his strength, which had been squandered by his <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-6" class="cross-link to-sand">delirium<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; feverish insomnia</span></a>. He abandoned all premeditation of dreaming and almost immediately succeeded in sleeping a reasonable part of each day. The few times that he had dreams during this <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">period<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; diverging periods</span></a>, he paid no attention to them. Before resuming his task, he waited until the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-3" class="cross-link to-sand">moon's<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; turning pages endlessly</span></a> disk was perfect. Then, in the afternoon, he purified himself in the <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-5" class="cross-link to-paths">waters<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the damp path</span></a> of the river, worshiped the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-2" class="cross-link to-sand">planetary<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; sacred volumes</span></a> gods, pronounced the prescribed <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">syllables<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the word for chess</span></a> of a mighty name, and went to sleep. He <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-8" class="cross-link to-paths">dreamed<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; the book and the labyrinth</span></a> almost immediately, with his <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">heart<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a beating heart</span></a> throbbing.

Every night he perceived it more <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-5" class="cross-link to-sand">clearly<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; examining the pages</span></a>. He did not touch it; he only permitted himself to <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">witness<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; seeing the impossible</span></a> it, to observe it, and occasionally to rectify it with a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-3" class="cross-link to-paths">glance<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; watching through the window</span></a>. He perceived it and lived it from all <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-9" class="cross-link to-paths">angles<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; all possible futures</span></a> and distances. On the fourteenth night he lightly touched the pulmonary <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-1" class="cross-link to-sand">artery<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; veins of the book</span></a> with his index <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-3" class="cross-link to-sand">finger<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; turning pages</span></a>, then the whole heart, outside and inside. He was satisfied with the examination.

The <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-4" class="cross-link to-sand">innumerable<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; infinite pages</span></a> hair was perhaps the most difficult task.

When he had exhausted all <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-4" class="cross-link to-paths">supplications<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a desperate plea</span></a> to the deities of earth, he threw himself at the feet of the <a href="BookOfSand.html#sand-2" class="cross-link to-sand">effigy<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; an idol of pages</span></a> which was perhaps a <a href="GardenOfPaths.html#paths-7" class="cross-link to-paths">tiger<span class="link-tooltip">&rarr; a beast in the garden</span></a> or perhaps a colt and implored its unknown help.
